- Find offending operator when throwing InvalidOperatorUseException exception
- Thoroughly test all functions by sampling random values, checking colouring, and testing at and beyond double precision limits
- Test and prevent input values in mindomain and maxdomain within dialog box for NaN
- If values overflow in calculator, inform user value is too large to store (arbitrary precision maybe?)
- Add real and imag functions 
- Throw FloatingOverflowException depending on precision type (single or double) (i.e. the number 1e300 will not throw an error for double, but will for float)
- Use regex '[+-]{2,}' to detect compounded unary negative/positive, and then compress into either single '-' or no character.
- Change type in token from int to enum
- Modify shunting yard algorithm to allow operations on constants (such as sin(pi)) to be resolved during setString. Also extend this for chained multiply and add.
- Complete save image feature
- Print time taken to create and display image in System.out.println
- Throw NonExpressionException if independent variable 'z' appears i min or max domain inputs in property dialog
